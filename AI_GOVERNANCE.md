# ðŸ¤– AI Governance Framework for ConnectED

## 1. Purpose & Scope

This framework ensures that all AI components in ConnectED operate responsibly, inclusively, and transparently. It applies to the current GPT-based integration (OpenAI API) and future proprietary NLP models, including multilingual and indigenous language capabilities.

## 2. Principles

- **Transparency** â€” Publish model versions, data sources, update logs, and known limitations via Model Cards.
- **Fairness & Inclusivity** â€” Curate diverse, representative datasets across regions, languages, and demographics; prioritize indigenous languages.
- **Accountability** â€” Human-in-the-loop review, measurable KPIs, and clear escalation/rollback procedures.
- **Privacy & Security** â€” Adhere to NDPR/GDPR with data minimization, encryption, consent, and retention controls.
- **Safety** â€” Prohibit harmful content and implement guardrails for medical/financial/legal content; default to official, verified sources.

## 3. Roles & Responsibilities

- **AI Lead**: Owns model lifecycle, evaluations, and bias audits.
- **Domain Reviewers (NGOs/MDAs)**: Verify sector content (health, agri, civic) before deployment.
- **Data/Privacy Officer**: Oversees NDPR/GDPR compliance and DPIA.
- **Engineering**: Implements telemetry, versioning, and rollback; maintains incident runbooks.
- **Community Stewards**: Manage public feedback, issues, and contributor onboarding.

## 4. Model Lifecycle Management

- **Versioning**: Semantic versioning (e.g., `nlp-hausa-1.2.0`). Each release logs: data changes, training config, eval metrics, known issues.
- **Change Control**: Use PRs + code review; deploy behind a feature flag or canary. Keep a rollback plan.
- **Retraining Cycle**: Quarterly (or earlier if KPIs regress), with dataset refresh and fairness re-evaluation.
- **Decommissioning**: Document reasons, migration steps, and sunset timelines.

## 5. Evaluation & Monitoring

- **Human-Centric Metrics**: SMS response helpfulness, clarity, and safety (CSAT/Likert from sampled replies).
- **Technical Metrics**: Accuracy on curated Q&A sets, latency, refusal rate, hallucination rate, BLEU for translation tasks.
- **Fairness Checks**: Group-wise disparity across languages/regions; toxicity and stereotype probes.
- **Production Monitoring**: Realâ€‘time alerts on spike in refusals, latency, or negative feedback; weekly review of samples.

## 6. Bias & Safety Audits

- **Quarterly Bias Audit**: 1Kâ€“5K sampled responses across domains and languages; label for bias, toxicity, misinformation.
- **Sensitive Domains**: Health/finance/civic queries routed to vetted, versioned knowledge packs; require higher confidence and include disclaimer SMS if needed.
- **Red Teaming**: Adversarial prompts in supported languages; track findings and mitigations in a public issue log.

## 7. User Feedback & Redress

- **In-SMS Reporting**: Users text `REPORT` to flag a response; autoâ€‘creates a ticket with anonymized context.
- **Corrections**: Reviewed within 72 hours; if systemic, trigger hotfix or model rollback.
- **Transparency**: Publish annual governance summary and changelog.

## 8. Documentation Artifacts

- **Model Cards** (per model) â€” purpose, training data, metrics, limitations, safety notes.
- **Data Statements** â€” collection sources, consent basis, sampling, preprocessing.
- **Risk Register** â€” top risks, likelihood/impact, mitigations, owners.

## 9. Compliance Hooks

- **Data Minimization**: Store only phone numbers and required logs; no children targeting.
- **Encryption**: Encrypt PII at rest; rotate keys and restrict access.
- **Consent & Rights**: `START`/`STOP` flows; data access/export/delete on request.
- **Retention**: Purge logs older than policy threshold (e.g., 12 months) automatically.
